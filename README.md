This is my improved notepad created using PyQt
It has features such as:

1. Ability to import .txt file ('Open file' button)
2. The ability to simply write text to .txt ('Save to txt file' button) or save it to .pdf ('Create PDF file' button)
3. Ability to print and configure file printing ('Print and Printer settings' button)
4. Preview the file before printing ('File preview' button)
5. Change text font ('Change Font' button)
6. Change text color ('Change color' button)
7. Saving the position of the window and the text in it

the application is a little crude, but all the main functions that I wanted to demonstrate the use of are in it

Before starting you need to enter the following commands:
* pip install PyQt5
